## üìñ Project Overview

The goal of this application is to display a list of schools participating in the **WizFit Challenge**. Due to unavailability of the API, a **mock data solution** was implemented along with a custom **pagination function**. The application adheres to a responsive design and provides search functionality for users to dynamically filter school results.

## üìä Mock Data and Pagination

Since the API was not functional, mock data was used. The `paginateAndSearch` function is located in `mock/school-list.ts` and operates as follows:

1. Filters the school list based on search input.
2. Divides results into pages, with customizable page size.
